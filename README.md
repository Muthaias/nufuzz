# Disclaimer
This is not the best code in the world. This is just a tribute. This entire project is just a way for me to experiment
with structures, typings and toughts in a familiar setting.

# NuFuzz
NuFuzz is a spelling error for No Fuzz. Since sloppy spelling is the new fad I am just rolling with it at the moment.
NuFuzz can also be read as NewFuzz since it's new and cool. Break your chains and join the movement of the NuFuzz.
It will help you generate a lot of data very quickly (not efficiently) but you will be able to express large data sets
with a reduced notation.

## What's it all about
It's all about generating data sets with a fairly compact notation. Doing it with uniquely identifiable parts and by
using shorthands to reduce the code footprint. Also `Typescript`.
The current api allows for the following:
* Creating values
* Creating value domains
* Creating tables
* Domain unions
* Domain intersections
* Calculating combinations
* Setting up tables
